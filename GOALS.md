* Reduce the overall maintenance cost of 'system' tests

* Allow for a single suite to be 'tuned' for different purposes
  * smoke suite
  * exhaustive regression suite
    * Correct first implementation
    The system should work as expected for all the possible program domains providing exhastive test paths a competent team would implement.
  * high value

* Drive a better system design through thinking about explicit system states

* MVP
  * a bananas test suite implemented against a preexisiting well written code base
    * identify this
  * exhaustive regression suite.
  * Lucid reporing, that is integrated with Mocha.
